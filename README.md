SWAPI graphql api is used to develop this project

## Details
Framework and libraries 
- Reactjs
- Apollo Client
- Bootstrap

## Assumptions and approaches
- Since there was no <b>search/filter resolver</b> in server side and I needed that functionality, I have added the search at frontend level instead.
